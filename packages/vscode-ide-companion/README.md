- Selection Context: LOCO Code can easily access your cursor's position and selected text within the editor, giving it valuable context directly from your current work.

- Native Diffing: Seamlessly view, modify, and accept code changes suggested by LOCO Code directly within the editor.

- Launch LOCO Code: Quickly start a new LOCO Code session from the Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P or Ctrl+Shift+P) by running the "LOCO Code: Run" command.
